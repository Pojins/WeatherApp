**Overview**  

This project is a weather web application that retrieves and displays real-time weather data for various cities worldwide. It was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with data fetched from a weather API. The application allows users to enter a city name and receive instant updates on temperature, humidity, wind speed, and overall weather conditions.  

The project follows the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), utilizing the Waterfall Model for a structured development process. It includes phases such as planning, analysis, design, implementation, testing, and deployment considerations. Key features of the web application include a user-friendly interface, dynamic content updates, API integration, and responsive design for various screen sizes.  

Challenges faced during development included choosing a reliable weather API, designing the UI using Figma, translating static designs into functional code, and handling API request limitations. Despite these challenges, the project was successfully completed with thorough testing and debugging to ensure smooth functionality.
